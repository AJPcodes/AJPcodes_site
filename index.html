    <h3>So what's this about?</h3>
    
    <p> My name is Allen Phelps. I'm an aspiring web developer attending part-time classes at Nashville software school. This site is a place for me to learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've also posted my resume for all you talent scouts, as well as links to some projects I'm working on. </p>
    
    <p>I'm still working on adding content, but feel free to check out my <a href="resume/resume.html" title="Resume Page">Resume </a>or <a href="interests/interests-main.html">Interests</a> pages</p>

    <p>Hopefully I'll have some projects to share with you (other than this site itself) soon.</p>
    <p>On this page, I've used Javascript to hide the Nav bar links when they aren't being used. I also animated the main heading.</p>
