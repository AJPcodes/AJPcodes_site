<h3>A Few of my absolute favorites.</h3>
    <p>I've been an avid reader for as long as I can remember. I started as a kid reading lots of SciFi and fantasy, and you'll probably note that I'm a sucker for novels set in the real world, with a little bit of a twist. Growing up with Harry Potter may have had a bit to do with that. That being said, the older I get the more time I find to mix in non-fiction. </p>

        <h4>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</h4>
        <h5>Salman Rushdie</h5>
        <p><img src=../_pics/thegroundbeneathherfeet.jpg title> Salman Rushdie wrote several novels I consider to be amazing reads, but this is my favorite, albeit closely followed by The Enchantress of Florence. </br></p>

        <h4>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</h4>
        <h5>Neil Gaiman</h5>
        <p><img src=../_pics/theoceanattheendofthelane.jpg title> Neil Gaimon is another author who I'm always delighted to read. This actually started as a long short story and ended as a short novel. It's an adorable, poignant coming of age story, set in the British countryside. Highlights include a grandmother who may remember the big bang that likes to boss around microbials and a villian who is a childhood nightmare of a houseguest come true.</p>

        <h4>Quiet</h4>
        <h5>Susan Cain</h5>
        <p><img src=../_pics/quiet.jpg title> I love this book because it gave me the framework and vocabulary to explain my personality type to other people. This is a must read-not just for introverts, but for people who know them (that's you!)</p>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <h4>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</h4>
        <h5>J.K. Rowling</h5>
        <p><img src=../_pics/HPHBP.jpg title> Because childhood. As much as I love the whole series. This is my favorite. Not to mention it's got one of the most dramatic endings in history. Eat your heart out Red Wedding, noone saw this one coming either. </p>
