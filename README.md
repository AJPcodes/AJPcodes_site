# AJPcodes_site

This was a personal project I used to reinforce my activities while beginning at NSS.
The main point was to practice HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and using Git in general. 

I created my new personal site AJPCodes.github.io using github pages and Jekyll. 
So that's a better place to look now.
